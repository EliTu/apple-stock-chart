## Apple Stock Chart component

This is a simple application that renders a chart that displays Apple's stock data, as provided by an API from FX Empire.
There are also few toggleable buttons that allow the user to switch between different time points (1 minute, 5 minutes, 1 hour, 1 week), which will in turn render different data.

The app also provides error catching and handling capabilities.

Made with:

- React (Hooks API)
- TypeScript
- Recharts
- Styled Components
- Axios
